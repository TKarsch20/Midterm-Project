# Dream Vacations

I have a few places I would love to vacation before I am no longer able to travel. Traveling has always been something I enjoyed, however my family would only drive places because we never left the United States. If I am able to travel to at least half of the places I want to go in my life, I feel I will have succeeded in my endeavor. I will now rank the countries in order of which one I want to go to first.

1. _Australia_
2. _Greece_
3. _Spain_
4. _England_
5. _Egypt_
