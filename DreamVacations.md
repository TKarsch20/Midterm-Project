# Dream Vacations

I have a few places I would love to vacation before I am no longer able to travel. Traveling has always been something I enjoyed, however my family would only drive places because we never left the United States. If I am able to travel to at least half of the places I want to go in my life, I feel I will have succeeded in my endeavor. I will now rank the countries in order of which one I want to go to first.

1. [_Australia_](https://www.australia.com/en-us)
2. [_Greece_](https://www.visitgreece.gr/)
3. [_Spain_](https://www.contiki.com/ap/en/destinations/europe/spain?gclid=Cj0KCQjw29CRBhCUARIsAOboZbKWQzEDdyLGAk5sYXZECAUjCNpZLEZCWw2aeQCI-oIxV09-k-ab6w4aAuZBEALw_wcB)
